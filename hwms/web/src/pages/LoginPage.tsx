/**
 * Sign-in.
 *
 * The layout follows the prototype the client reviewed and approved: a dark
 * branded panel carrying the KMC mark on one side, the sign-in action on the
 * other. That arrangement is settled and is not re-litigated here.
 *
 * What differs from the prototype is what the right panel does. This page
 * collects no credentials. It hands the browser to Keycloak, which owns
 * password policy, lockout, multi-factor and, later, corporate single
 * sign-on. The application never sees a password, which is both safer and the
 * reason moving to corporate sign-on later is a configuration change rather
 * than a release.
