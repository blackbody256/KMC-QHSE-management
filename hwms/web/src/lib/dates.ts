/**
 * Local calendar helpers.

 * `new Date().toISOString()` gives the UTC date. Kampala runs at UTC+3, so
 * between local midnight and 03:00 it returns *yesterday*, and on the first of
 * the month, last month. A clinic that opens early, or an officer finishing a
 * late entry, would have the wrong date defaulted into a clinical form or the
 * wrong reporting month opened in the returns screen, and neither is obvious
 * enough to catch by eye.
 *
 * Everything that needs "today" or "this month" comes from here. There should
 * be no `toISOString()` in a page.
