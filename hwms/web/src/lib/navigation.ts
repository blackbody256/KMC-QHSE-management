/**
 * The navigation and route table for the whole system.
 *
 * This is the single declaration of who may open what. The rail renders from
 * it, the route guards read it, and the redirect after sign-in derives from
 * it. Two lists would eventually disagree, and the one that disagreed silently
 * would be the one governing access.
 *
 * The structure follows the prototype the client approved: the Health and
 * Wellness division and its three units. Quality Inspection and Environment
 * and Sustainability were removed when the client established that those
 * divisions already run their own systems.
 *
 * Items are hidden entirely, never disabled, when a role has no access. A
 * disabled control tells someone there is something they are not allowed to
 * do, which invites a conversation about being allowed to do it.
